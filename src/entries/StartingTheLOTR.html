        <p>This morning, I woke up and saw Aunt Fanny mopping my floor pretty early.  I went outside while Mom was taking a shower.  Then we started some more school work.  Dad was working at the table, and said he was getting some good progress.  I started my math before Mom got out of the shower, and was half finished when she did.  Mom was very very happy and impressed.  Mom learned how to cook groundnuts (peanuts) and we had those and pineapple for breakfast.  After I finished reading and handwriting, I went to go play outside some more.  It drizzled on me, but I barely felt it.  We ate bananas and beans with relish and lepo.  After lunch, I began to read The Lord of the Rings.  I think it is an awesome book.  So far, I have only gotten to the end of Bilbo’s Eleventy-First (111) birthday party.  In part of the book, one of Bilbo’s relatives, during his last adventure, stole his spoons.  Because she had stolen so many, he made a gift of the remainder of them to her.  She was mad because she already had most of his spoons.  This book is mixed with humor, seriousness, and a little sadness too, and LOTS of suspense.  After I was finished reading, the power went out for a while.  It rained a lot today, but it didn’t stop me from playing.  Mom and Aunt Fanny had to cook in the dark, but we have a gas stove, which is good.  We had some tasty leftovers.  I had lepo, beans, and meat.  I called it the Trio.  Then I went to bed.
