Malawi is a long, skinny country, in the heart of Africa.  It’s a very small country-it’s so small, most people don’t even know about it.  It is 560 miles long, which is very long, but its width is 155 miles wide.  Malawi is as big as the distance from College Station, Texas, to Witchita, Kansas, and the width is the distance of Houston, Texas, to Austin, Texas.

The capital of Malawi is Lilongwe, which is in the middle of Malawi.  Malawi is divided into 3 regions, the Northern Region, the Southern Region, and the Central Region.  We are in the Southern Region.  Ntcheu is the village I was born in, before I went to the Good Samaritan Children’s Home.  It is in the Central Region, on the way from Blantyre to Lilongwe.   Thyolo, which is Chiboda’s village, is just south of Blantyre.

This trip, we are living in Chigumula.  Chigumula is a small village south of Blantyre but still in Blantyre District.  Our house is on a dirt road that is very much used, which is quite obvious because of all of the large potholes in it.  This house has a big metal gate and an electric brick wall that goes the whole perimeter of our yard, which is almost a square.  Inside the gate, there is a driveway which is made out of bricks that have been put together to make a nice smooth driveway.  At the end of the driveway, is our house and another family’s house who takes care of this house and makes sure it is in good shape for the next people to come in.  This is where Fiona, Uncle Peter, and their family live.

You might be wondering why I have so many Uncles here.  It’s not that I have so many uncles, the word Uncle is a way to respect men who are older than you.  Uncle Peter is the manager of the house.

He takes out the trash, fills up the generator when the power is out, and he mops the lanais. He also opens the gate for us when we are going to go out, and he helps with stuff when we need help.  The other daytime helper is Uncle Kenneth, who sweeps the path and the dirt.

He mows the grass and burns the bad shrubs.  I helped him plant a garden.  We transplanted potato plants, and planted corn seeds. The last two, which are night helpers, are guards.  Their names are Uncle Foster and Uncle Amos, and they’re my best friends.  When they come, we play soccer, and we talk, and I help Uncle Foster cook his nsima.  After I eat dinner, we talk some more until it is time for me to go to bed.  We sometimes talk about songs, their jobs, and if they have ever had criminals come and attack them.  Very comfortingly, that has never happened.  I think that’s because there is a big sign that says the house is protected by an electric fence and a camera, and the giant metal gate.

Out on the road, there are two roads which help remind me North, South, East, West, because it is all the directions.

Behind our property, are some people with a huge garden that I talk to sometimes, by climbing into the avocado tree so I can see them.  They speak a little English, but I play with the two younger ones by making animal noises, and they copy me.

The house is different from those in America.  The windows have large bars, and a latch that looks weird, with two prongs that go over a little bump so no one can open them from the outside.  Every morning when we wake up, we open up the windows so the wind can get through, and we can hear the birds.  At night we close them, so no mosquitos can get in, which will give you Malaria.  We close up the curtains.

The doors are huge and strong.  When we close the doors at night, the locks are gigantic-they’re the size of my hand.  The walls are built of solid bricks, so they don’t make as much noise as American walls.  The brick is then covered by plaster on the outside so it doesn’t look ugly.  The floors have tiles everywhere.  Every room has tiles on the floor.  If you go into a room, you will never escape from tiles.  The roofs are made of metal, and the ceilings are of plaster.  Our house is a very nice house, and not like a traditional Malawian house.  Most Malawians use brick for their walls, but they have no plaster to cover them up.  Their houses are smaller and are more vulnerable to rain and can wash away.  Their windows are made of holes in the wall.  They don’t have glass or the bars, just holes in the wall.  Their doors are also frequently holes in the wall, but richer people have the nice wooden doors.  The floors in a normal Malawian house are made of brick or they just might be the dirt themselves.  We have electricity and running water.  We don’t have to walk a long way away to get water, but poor people have no electricity and they have to walk a very long way to get water.  We have toilets, but people in the villages have outdoor toilets, which are dug into the ground.

I hope you liked learning about where we are living and how the houses are made here in Malawi.
