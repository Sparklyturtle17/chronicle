        <p>After we landed in the huge Atlanta airport we staggered down the hall to our terminal. We finally got to the terminal where we could get some food for ourselves because we  were so hungry. We got to our terminal and sat down then went to go get food in pairs so that we had some people to watch over the luggage so no one stole our bags.I got Panda Express and Mom got Qqdoba.  Chiboda and Dad both got Arby’s.  Apparently, the Atlanta airport doesn’t know about air conditioning, so we melted until it was time to get on our flight to South Africa.  The plane to South Africa was huge, because South Africa was over 8,500 miles away.  What was special about the plane was that it was made out of carbon fibers which are one of the strongest substances on Earth.  We were almost in the very back of the plane which was exciting because you got to see the whole plane tip upward when it took off.  About 30 minutes after we got onto the plane, we had dinner.  I ate some ravioli that was pretty tasty.  Dad ate shrimp and Mom had the pasta as well.  Chiboda was already asleep, so he skipped dinner.  Since it was a 15 hour flight, we slept a long time, but even that long of sleeping, we didn’t even get to halfway through the flight.  When we woke up, they served us a tasty breakfast of breakfast calzones, fruit, and yogurt.  It was so tasty.  I watched a movie and Dad taught me how to play solitaire, which is a very fun game.  The time zone caused it to be night time in South Africa right after we had eaten breakfast.  
DELTA COOKIE
After we got to the airport, we got all of our bags and went to the hotel where we stayed the night to wait for our flight to Malawi.  Walking through the airport to the hotel, Chiboda was trying to take the trolley of bags down the escalator, but he didn’t know how to do it, so a lot of them toppled off and we were all laughing.  The hotel had a pretty nice dinner and breakfast buffet.  I felt pretty terrible.  I was tired and sore because lugging those heavy bags was hard on me.  Even though I got a good night’s sleep on the plane, I was still tired and went right to sleep in the hotel.
The next morning, we woke up a little less tired than yesterday.  We all went to breakfast together and I had a nice full breakfast of 2 sausages, some bacon, eggs, and pancakes that were made by a cool machine.  It spurted the batter out from a nozzle onto a conveyor belt, and there was a metal plate that slowly squished down and on the bottom of the conveyor belt, there was a bunch of heat, so it was getting cooked and squished at the same time-no hands needed!
After breakfast, we turned in our bags that were going to go under the plane, and went through security, which was much shorter than I expected.  When it was time to get to the plane ,we got on a bus and drove to it.  It was a tiny plane!  The big plane to South Africa was 9 seats across, but this one to Blantyre was only 3. That is so small!  That flight was about two hours and then we landed in Blantyre! 
VIEW FROM PLANE
It was so hot! There wasn’t even a big tunnel to get to the airport, we just walked on the runway and went inside.  After we got our bags and went through security, we met some people who organized us to rent the car and find and prepare the house.  The people were very nice and the lady even brought her 3 children to meet us.  Then we got into the car, but it wasn’t our car-it was another lady’s car who had come to pick us up.  We went to Shoprite and got Mom, Dad, and Chiboda’s phones turned on, and ate  at KIPS.  KIPS is a restaurant where they have chicken and chips (french fries).  If you order something on the menu, it probably will have chips with it.  After we ate, Mom went shopping to get some food for one day, to stay because she said we could get food to last us a week later.  Then we headed to the house.
The house is humongous! It has a big big yard and mango trees, corn, tomatoes, sugar cane, and guavas.  I get to have my own room, which is pretty nice, and there is a nice room with a fireplace that is really, really big.  It is probably twice the size of the room that I am staying in.  I think the house is pretty good, other than that there are no lightbulbs in the bathroom.  We ate dinner and then went to bed for our first night in Malawi!
I woke up the next morning at 5:00, because the time zone changed , and the sun rising early did not help me at all.  I went outside into our garden and met a little girl named Fiona.  She is the daughter of one of the men who takes care of the house.  They live in a small house right next to us, inside our walls.  I played outside with her a lot, and I got so tired that I almost fell asleep on our driveway.  Mom woke me up so I could go to my bed.  I slept for a while and then woke up thinking it was the next day, and remembering nothing about before my nap.  Then I went to go check on Dad, who was very very sick.  He got e. coli from eating some pork sausages for breakfast at the hotel in South Africa.  I had dinner and then went to bed early because I was so tired.  
I woke up at 10:00 the next morning.  Dad was still very sick, and Mom, Fanny, and Chiboda had gone to the market.  The driving was hard for Mom because instead of the steering wheel being on the left side, it was on the right side, which made everything go in reverse.  I played with Fiona some more, but I was more on guard for Dad because he was so sick and very very very weak.  It was about 3.5 hours before they got home.  They brought food and other things from the market, and Spencer’s school uniforms.  Mom and Fanny cooked ramen with telele (okra), tomatoes, and onions for dinner.  Man, that meal was so tasty.
On Tuesday, it was Chiboda’s first day of school.  I saw Fiona after her cshool and we walked over to the mango trees.  When I was shaking mangos out of the tree for Fiona, I didn’t realize there was one right above me and when I shook it, it landed right on my head, bounced right off, and fell on the ground.  That was the funniest part of the day.  Mom had gone out to do some more shopping and I hung out around the house until she got back.
