In order for you to better understand our time in Malawi, you need to understand how Malawi works.  First, we can learn about the location of Malawi.  Malawi is a tiny landlocked country in southern Africa.  Landlocked means it is surrounded by land and has no way to get to the ocean.  It touches Mozambique, Zambia, and Tanzania.  Malawi is approximately 9,000 miles from the USA.  That’s a very very long way away.  To get here, we had to fly from Houston to Atlanta, and then from Atlanta to South Africa and then South Africa to Malawi. It took us 49 hours and 51 minutes to get from Gogo’s house to our home here in Malawi.  Malawi is 8 hours ahead of Texas, so even though it should have taken us two days, because of the time zones, it took us almost 3.  Malawi’s time zone is called Central African Time, just like how in America there is Mountain time, Eastern time, Central time, and Western time.  Malawi has two official languages .  Those two languages are English and Chichewa.  I used to speak Chichewa, but I forgot it and it doesn’t mean much to me anymore.  I am going to learn it again while we are here.  English is used for the government and the president, and at shops because the packages of most things are in English, so they can’t use the Chichewa word for them.  In schools, grade number 1, which is called Standard 1 here, through 4th grade, everything is in Chichewa except their English classes.  Their instruction starts becoming all in English (except Chichewa classes) in grade 5.  Chichewa is used at marketplaces and everywhere else.  To have conversations, people usually use Chichewa.  Lastly, we are going to learn about currency.  In Malawi, they use the Malawian Kwatcha and if you’re trying to guess how many Kwatcha are in one dollar, that is 1,735 for one dollar.  Their coins are called tambala.  Tambala in the Chichewa language means rooster.  The coins are called tambala because on the coins there is a picture of a rooster.  There is even a 1 Kwatcha tambala.  A 2,000 Kwatcha bill can buy you about 20-30 tomatoes.  Now that you know more about Malawi, you can start understanding my blog posts better.  I hope you have good days.
