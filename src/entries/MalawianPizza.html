This morning, I had cereal for breakfast.  Dad, Mom, and I went to Shoprite so we could get a few things.  The parking lot was empty.  We got some oatmeal and we tried to find sheets for Dad and Mom’s bed.  On the way out of Shoprite, there was a book that I saw the other day, and so Mom got it for me.  It is about the history of the Ngoni.  It was special because I come from that tribe.  After we got back from Shoprite, we had beans and rice that Aunt Fanny made.  We sat outside on the lanai and I did some school work and made a few drawings with Fiona, while Fiona’s mother was getting her hair braided by Aunt Fanny.  After we were all finished doing our things, we started making dinner.  For dinner, we had some salad and pizza.  The pizza's crust wasn’t very crispy, and instead of pizza sauce, it was almost like ketchup.  It wasn't a very good pizza.  Then, I went to bed.  Before I can get into bed, I have to set up the mosquito net so I don’t get bitten in the night.  I have to tuck it under the mattress, then make sure there are no openings that mosquitos can get it.  To make it extra safe, I clip the sheet with the mosquito net, so there is no hole.  I have to pull the net taught, so my head and feet have enough room to keep the net off of my body.  If the net is on my body, the mosquitos can still land on me and bite me.
