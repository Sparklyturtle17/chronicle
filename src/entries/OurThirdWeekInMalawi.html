Hello, welcome to the blog. Last week was a very fun week.  On Monday, I woke up to no power, which was unpleasant because I wanted to take a shower that morning.  Then Amayi woke up and together we opened up all the windows and doors, and swept the floor.  After a little while, Mom woke up.  I thought it was a long time, because I woke up very early.  For breakfast, Mom cooked some amazing breakfast tacos.  It was so large though, that we didn’t even have a proper lunch; I had a mango.  That afternoon, we tried some cassava, which was so tasty, I had some with breakfast the next morning.  Cassava is the texture of a potato and the taste of a potato, but just a little bit sweeter, in my opinion.  For dinner, we had spaghetti with soya pieces in it.  The soya tasted so much like meat, that Dad and I didn’t even notice that it was soya.  After dinner, it began to POUR.  I listened to the rain and thunder, but the first thunderclap was so large and unexpected, that I jumped and screamed.  I played in the rain and I stomped around in it, and laughed so hard that my stomach hurt after I was done laughing.

Tuesday, I woke up early and started on my schoolwork.  When Mom woke up, she was impressed to see that I was already almost done with all of my reading.  I finished it up and then we did math, which was easy.  That afternoon, Mom and Amayi went to the store, and ran into Nursey and another caregiver, from Good Samaritan, which is a Children’s Home.  It is special to me, because I was raised there before Mom and Dad adopted me.  While Mom and Aunt Fanny were gone, I helped Dad with a few case studies for his research project, which are fun.  They’re kind of like looking at a graph or chart to see what happened to this person who was sick.  When Mom got back, I had a coding lesson with Aunt Olivia, which was fun.  She is teaching me how to use code so I can talk to computers and so I can make the blog.  For the blog, I am using html, which is a kind of computer language, just like how there is Swahili, or English, or all of the other languages.  After my lesson, I went outside to kick the ball with my friends that I had met.  I have about 8 friends and we play soccer, and my position is goalie.  I am really good at it because I play catcher in baseball, which is kind of like it.

On Wednesday, Mom and Dad had to go to Chiboda’s school so they could pick him up because he was sick.  While they were gone, I finished my schoolwork and played.  When they got back, they had samosas and some soft buns from Serendib.

On Thursday, in the night, the furniture came!  Dad can have a proper office and I can have a proper schoolroom, instead of sitting at the kitchen table.

After lunch, I had a coding lesson with Aunt Olivia and Chiboda escorted Mom around the village, where Chiboda likes to go a lot.  After coding with Aunt Olivia, I went to go play with my friends for almost 3 whole HOURS.  Then, for dinner, we had the best dinner yet…GUMBO!!!

Gumbo is special because we eat it in Texas and they had everything that we needed, because gumbo has so many vegetables and nice meats, that it’s easy to find it here.

On Friday, Dad did his grant while Mom helped him, and I did my schoolwork.  <img src="/chronicle/images/Sleepy-Feek.jpg" alt="Sleepy Feek" class="h-64 w-auto" />
That afternoon, Uncle Peter and Uncle Kenneth, with Mom and Amayi, helped fix the leaky fridge, because we didn’t want to have to mop it every hour.  That evening, we taught Amayi how to play Abduction, which is a very fun game.  I think she really liked it, and she is starting to learn the cards.  We were almost finished with the game, when ESCOM went out, but luckily, Mom and Amayi had dinner, so we could eat and not have to cook with the gas stove in the dark.

Saturday was Good Samaritan Day! A day that I had been waiting for.  We thought that the drive would be very long, but nope-it was like 20 minutes, which means we can go there more often than we thought.  After we got out of the car, Chiboda’s brother Innocent ran up and gave him a huge hug.  Then, I went to race Efraim, who is also Chiboda’s brother, and I WON! Efraim was FAST, but I beat him.  I talked to my friends and looked for the people who Amayi had wanted me to find, and I found some of them.  I walked around with Efraim and Timothy, and we played soccer and six gear, which is a fun game.  Then, Mom and Dad handed out lollipops to each and every kid at Good Samaritan, and there was still some left over which we left for the high school students who were at Saturday school, preparing for their exams.  On the way home, we got some KFC, which was so tasty.  Then we went home.

Sunday morning, after breakfast, We took a big long walk with Chiboda at the marketplace, because he wanted to show us where he went a lot of times.  It was a very long walk.  I saw a bunch of kids, I saw all kinds of shops, like one that sold candy, or meat.  They had gaming shops, electrician shops, vegetable shops, and all kinds of shops.  I was so happy and we walked almost 4 miles.  We came home, and I played outside.  Amayi taught me how to speak Chichewa a little bit.  It was lots of fun and I learned the vowels of Chichewa and some of the basic words.

For lunch, the chambo man came, so we had fresh 🐟 and relish, and rice with it.  It was deLICIOUS!

My chambo was a female and it had a chunk of eggs that had been fried, so I ate them! It was fried caviar!  It was disgusting-it didn’t taste very good-it had no meat.  You would have to eat about 20,000 of those before you would be even close to full.

I played with my friends for a long time.  We played football and one of my friends taught me how to do a walking hand stand.  That’s so much fun that in between my schoolwork, I practice.
