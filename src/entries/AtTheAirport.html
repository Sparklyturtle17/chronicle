        <h2>At the Airport</h2>
        <p> Today we are in the airport. After days of packing we are finally in the air port! Today we board a small plane to Atlanta, I am, so excited.When we were packing for Malawi there was a huge bag that was 75 lbs! All the bags had baseballs and spices like texjoy and ranch powder and a whole bucket of baseballs.The best part was that there was a bag as big as me,it was humongos! Before we left for the airport I went to see my friends one last time to play baseball with them.Then we went to Gogo's house to leave for the airport. That's where we are now waiting for our flight to Atlanta. While we were there my dad got some water for my mom and and held it in front of her and just stood there. We are currently watching for our plane.
