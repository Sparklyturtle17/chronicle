This past week, a few interesting things happened.  On Tuesday, for lunch, we had some very tasty sausage and amazing mashed potatoes.  What made them amazing were the awesome ingredients that were put on them-Mom put green onion, butter, and cheese.  That was special because there isn’t much cheese in Malawi and it is very expensive.  Mom had gotten a big net and brought it to Malawi so I could hit balls into it.  We hit for a long time and then Aunt Fanny heard the noise, so she came to see what was going on.  We gave her a turn with the tee, and she was good! She made contact every time, and she never knocked the tee down.  I also did some of my baseball lessons on the iPad.  DRIBBLEUP ON THE LANAI PIC I think they are ok because it is taking some getting used to.  I finished a watercolor painting of a spectacled bear.  I named him Veggie because they mostly eat fruits and vegetables instead of meat.  VEGGIE PIC

On Wednesday, Mom made poached eggs for herself, but no one else wanted them so we all had boiled eggs that were in a circular shape instead of an egg shape for breakfast.  That afternoon, Emmanuel’s wife, the lady who picked us up from the airport and had helped us get the house and car sorted out, came over to collect some gifts that we had brought for her children.  In the evening, Spencer came in telling us that the guards didn’t get paid so they couldn’t feed their families.  We gave them 15,000 MWK which Aunt Fanny said could feed their families for a whole week.  It converts to $8.65.  Added to that, we also cooked them dinner because they didn’t have any food and they are OUR guards and Dad says that he protects his people.

On Thursday, Mom went shopping for a long time with Aunt Fanny. They tried out new shops and they also went to Saver’s Choice.  That was special to Mom because Aunt Olivia had taken Mom to it when we were here before, and it was JUST the same, Mom said.  That day, Spencer had no school because it was a holiday.  The holiday was for John Chilembwe, who was a person who fought in the revolution for Malawi’s independence.

On Friday, Mom, Aunt Fanny and I went shopping for a long time.  We got some groceries then went to the Wool Shop.  It was like a little hut and the road to get there was bumpy and had pot holes that were deep.  The shop had lots of fabrics, yarn, and thread, it had knitting needles, and all kinds of stuff.  Mom got some fat quarters for her embroidery and Aunt Fanny was stoked to learn how to embroidery.  Then we came home.  For lunch, we had nsima and okra! It was DELICIOUS! Nsima is a food that Malawians eat every day and we like it.  It is a corn flour mush that is more solid like play doh.  They eat it with their hands and roll it into balls.  Then they use it to scoop up the vegetables or meat that they have, and then put it in their mouth.BASEBALL WITH DAD PIC

Then SaTuRdAy! Saturday, Spencer and Aunt Fanny went to the market.  Spencer came home with all of the groceries while Aunt Fanny went to go to church.  There were tomatoes, onions, mangoes, sweet potatoes and irish potatoes, cassava, tiny bell peppers, carrots, cilantro, and that's all I can remember.  Mom and I washed and scrubbed all of the produce clean, while we listened to our audiobook.

On Sunday, I crumbled some bread on the ground for the birds.  A lot of birds came to eat it.  In the afternoon, we saw a CHAMELEON! It was about 10 inches long. He was SO COOL! CHAMELEON PIC I never thought I would see a chameleon in Malawi.  I tried to give him a piece of a mango, but he didn’t want it.  Dad thought he was weird because he can move each eye independently.  Aunt Fanny says that in Malawi, if you’re lucky, you can see big chameleons with horns.  The chameleon was so cool that I named him.  I named him Roy G. Biv, for the rainbow.  I spent over an hour just lookin’ at him.  In the afternoon, the wind got very very bad and I was in the tree, seeing if it was really really bad.  It started drizzling.  It kept drizzling for about one whole hour.  Because the clouds were so grey, we thought it was going to be a downpour.  All of a sudden, it started pouring.  Gallons after gallons were falling from the sky.  While it was raining, I was helping Uncle Kenneth cook some nsima and corn, and I even made a little fire by myself.  For a fire starter, I poked a big leaf into his fire, and put it under some dry smaller leaves which had sticks in them, so it lit up the sticks.  RAIN VIDEO After the storm, we went out to get KFC for dinner.  It’s not like you’d expect in America where KFC is terrible.  KFC BOY PIC Here in Malawi, the KFC is just AWESOME.  KFC GROUP PIC If you ever come to Malawi and don’t get KFC, then you are wrong.  Very wrong.  Then we came back and went to bed.
