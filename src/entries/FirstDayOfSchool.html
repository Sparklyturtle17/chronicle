        <p>This morning, I woke up early because the sun was up.  I cooked breakfast for everyone.  I made eggs with onions and Aunt Fanny made carrots and chips.  It was very tasty and Dad even ate it too, because he was less sick.  After I ate breakfast, I did a couple dishes and then I started my first day of school.  I am starting 5th grade Math and Reading this week.  In reading, something that is new for level 5 is that they have States and Capitals ladders.  I have to memorize some states and their capitals, and I am doing pretty well.  There is a cool new poem that I am learning and trying to memorize.  I will tell it to you once I have it memorized.  In math, the first lesson was about number patterns.  After I finished my schoolwork, I went outside to play with Fiona some more.  When Mom got home from shopping, I helped her put a nice new net together, so Mom and Dad wouldn’t get bitten by so many mosquitos at night.  Then I went outside, and one of my friends was there.  His name is Uncle Foster, he is one of our security guards.  We kicked Chiboda’s soccer ball for almost 2 hours and had lots of fun.
