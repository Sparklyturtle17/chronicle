Yesterday, a man at the gate was selling chambo (fish), so Fanny got some for us to cook.  We also bought some for Fiona’s family.  The chambo took a very long time to cook, but it was delicious.  We also had some sweet potatoes. The special thing about Malawian sweet potatoes, is that they are white like our irish potatoes.  We also had some relish on the fish.  Relish is a sauce made from tomatoes and onions.  After lunch, we went shopping for a few things. We went to shop at GAME, where we found cereal!  I was so excited about it, that Mom got some for me.  All through the store, I was hugging the bag and kissing the bag.  For dinner, we had grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato sauce.  It was similar to what we have at home.

Today, I had corn flakes cereal for breakfast! It made me feel super duper happy because I haven’t had cereal in a long long time.  It tasted the exact same as American corn flakes.  The milk tasted better, probably because there are no pesticides on the Malawian corn, so they’re not full of pesticides and we don’t drink them.  A little bit after breakfast, we threw the baseball, which was fun.  I only missed 2 balls.  I got smacked in the shoulder by Mom, but I was ok.  Dad was helping the guards fix the light out at the gate, so then our power doesn’t go out when they try to use the light at night.  After being outside a little bit, I went back inside and got my tape, paper, and markers.  I took leaves from dead corn plants, and made a cape out of them, and I also made a crown that was made of 2 twigs and some pine needles, with tape.  I was a corn elf. 🌽 🧝

   I went inside to read a little bit more of The Lord of the Rings.  Now, I am on chapter 4, A Shortcut to Mushrooms.  The Lord of the Rings is an awesome book.  Did you know that it inspired all of the other fantasy books?  We had some very tasty chicken and relish for dinner.  Mom made some nsima cakes, which is maize flour that was fried in a pan and is thick and good to use as a wiping up bread for the relish.  After that, I went to bed.
